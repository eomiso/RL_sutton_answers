# Exercise 1.2 : Symmetries

## Answer

1. Improvements by the change
  - the size of the state space will reduce, therefore less computation for searching

2. If the opponent doesn't use symmetry
  - it may not result in optimum if the opponent is not using symmetry. For instance if the opponent tends to make a mistake in one corner, using symmetry would lead to failing in that feature.
